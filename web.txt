message=Dear Broque Ramdisk PRO users, our new registration server have also been banned for unknown reasons. We are sorry to announce this, but we will surely find a way around this and be back way stronger and stable. 

However, If you would like to have an offline version for yourself without any interruptions, inbox me on telegram or WhatsApp. Thank you.
